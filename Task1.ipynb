    "### 1.1. Components Necessary for the *counts()* Function\n",
    "\n",
    "The Task requires for the production of a function that takes a list as input and outputs a dictionary of key/value pairs of the elements/occurrences from the list. \n",
    "\n",
    "Achieving this will necessitate the use of a *for* loop, in order to iterate through each element of the list so that they can be translated into keys in a dictionary.\n",
    "\n",
    "Furthermore, the function will make use of a method Python has built-in for working with Dictionaries; the .get() method. This function will be used within the loop in order to get a key value for each element of the list and to count the number of each element incrementally moving throgh each element. \n",
    "\n",
    "Therefore, the *counts()* function will utilise 4 main components:\n",

    "<span style=\"color:blue\">**4. The .get() Method**</span>\n",
