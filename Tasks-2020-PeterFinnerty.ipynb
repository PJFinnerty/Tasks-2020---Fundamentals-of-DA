    "### 2.1. The Necessary Components of the Function\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Parameters: *k, n* and *sides*\n",
    "\n",
    "The Function is required to contain two parameters, the number of dice to be rolled in the simulation (*k*) and the number of dice rolls in the simulation (*n*). The minimum number of dice that should be simulated is 2. There should be no limit on the number of rolls simulated.\n",
    "\n",
    "In addition to this the k value will be multiplied by 6 within the function to account for the 6 sides and combinations of a single die. \n",
    "\n",
    "#### Dictionary\n",
    "\n",
    "Similar to the function created for Task 1, the *dicerolls* function should utilise a dictionary, in order to produce an output that will provide a dictionary return of key/value pairs (or *k's* and *n's*).\n",
    "\n",
    "Therefore, the keys in the dictionary should be the unique combinations of dice, e.g. for 2 dice the keys will be 2-12 inclusive. \n",
    "\n",
    "The values should provide the number of times out of the total rolls, *n*, where each possible dice result occurred. So if there are two dice and they are rolled 20 times, if the result of 2 occurrs once, the result of 3 occurs twice and the output of 4 occurs three times, the output should read: 2:1, 3:2, 4:3 ... and so on for each possible combinations. These numbers will function as the values in the dictionary pairs.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Numpy's Random Module\n",
    "\n",
    "In contrast to Task 1, Task 2 requires the creation of a function that can simulate the 'randomness' of rolling dice. As such it is necessary to create random numbers. To do this, we will use the numpy.random package. This package includes various method for the simulation of pseudo-random numbers. We will be using the Numpy random.integers() function."

    "### 2.2. The Distribution of the Outcomes of Rolled Dice\n",
    "\n",
    "It may seem intuitive that the probabilities for each combination of dice roll, remain the same regardless of how many dice are being rolled. The assumed probability is the Uniform distribution, whereby, each combination are equally as likely to happen.\n",
    "\n",
    "However, this is only true when a single die is being rolled. As a single die produces a single result ranging from 1-6 inclusive, every possibile outcome is equally possible. If the die is rolled 1000 times, the distribution of the outcomes is even, the same as the probability of a single die rolled once is even. This places a the outcomes of a single die rolled repeatedy in the Uniform Distribution.\n",
    "\n",
    "When more than one die are rolled, for example 2 dice and the sum of the outcomes for each combination is graphed, we will be presented with a distribution that resembles the Gaussian Distribution. A bell shaped curve, where the peak is at the combination of 7. For the other outcomes getting closer to 1 or to 12, the probability decreases steadily. \n",
    "\n",
    "This is due to the fact that there are more outcomes from rolling two dice that result in 7 than any other outcome.\n",
    "\n",
    "The table below illustrates the potential outcomes of rolling 2 dice, one after the other. The diagonal line from the top right to the bottom left contains 6 outcomes, each of which result in 7 (note: this table represents a dice being rolled twice repeatedly and therefore includes the reverse outcomes, e.g. 3 and 4 / 4 and 3).

    "\n",
    "The Bernoulli Distribution can be used to describe an event whereby the result will be measured as either a success or failure, and where *p* often stands for the probability of a particular outcome (i.e. success). A random variable that takes value 1 in case of success and 0 in case of failure is called a Bernoulli random variable.\n",
    "\n",
    "A Binomial Distribution describes where a Bernoulli experiment is repeated. We take the Bernoulli probability variable *p* and carry out the experiment of 'success/failure' *n* number of times. From this repetition we calculate the number of successes (e.g. the outcome of heads in a coin toss) and assign it the variable *X*. The distribution of the number of *X* is the Binomial Distribution. Essentially, a binomial random variable counts how often a particular event occurs in a fixed number of tries or trials. \n",
    "\n",
    "Therefore, the primary differences between the two distributions are that Bernoulli distributions describe success/failure outcomes, with a parameter input ascribing a value of either 1 or 0 to success or to failure. Contrastly, Binomial distributions allow for *n* number of trials and for the whole experiment to be repeated a fixed amount of times (this is where the *size* parameter comes into play)."

    "Simpson’s Paradox occurs when trends that appear when a dataset is separated into groups reverse when the data are aggregated (towardsdatascience.com).\n",

    "A simple example of how this paradox can occur is in the choosing of a restaurant based on (i) male and female reviews and (ii) all reviews combined (towardsdatascience.com).\n",
    "\n",
    "In this example a couple that are looking for the best recommended restaurant to eat at both look up user reviews for two restaurants (Sophia's and Carlo's). However, the first person looks up the restaurant that has a higher rating from men and women separately, whilst the second person looks up the highest reviews from both combined. \n",

Conversely, the trend that is seen across the 4 datasets is a high population of data in the lower ranges of x values, along the y axis. As a result, I have drawn the black line across this data, to highlight how when the data is viewed altogether, Simpson's Paradox is evident."
